## AI Reflection

*Use this section to reflect on how you used AI while working on this project.*

- **How I used AI** : I used AI to debug CSS errors I encountered in the browser's inspect tool. I also referenced AI for CSS property syntax and looked up the correct syntax for React's onClick event handler. Additionally, I used Cursor to help reorganize my repository structure and create a basic README template.
### Prompts 

 - "Give me CSS properties when styling divs"

 - "What is the syntax when using a variable to set a background color in React inline styles?"
