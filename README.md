## AI Reflection

*Use this section to reflect on how you used AI while working on this project.*

- **How I used AI** : I used AI to firstly help me debug some of the CSS error I was getting  when looking at the broswer's inspect. I then used it as a reference for CSS properties. I also used Ai to give syntax for OnClick. Other than that, I used cursor to reorganize my repo strucutre a nd to give me a simple template for the ReadMe document. 

***Prompts*** 

 - Give me CSS properties when styling divs

 - What is syntax when using a varible to set a background color
